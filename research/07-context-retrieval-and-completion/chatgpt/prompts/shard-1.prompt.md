You are one worker inside an automated literature-review pipeline.
A script, not a person, reads your reply. Follow these rules exactly:
- Do the task completely in this single reply. Do not ask questions and do not
  wait for confirmation.
- Reply with the requested artifact block(s) only: no preamble, no commentary
  outside the blocks. Each block starts with a line `===BEGIN <name>===` and
  ends with a line `===END <name>===`; the content between those lines is
  written to a file verbatim.
- Never invent papers, identifiers, numbers, or quotes. Leave unknown fields
  out or mark them as unknown.
- Do not use your code tool, canvas, or connectors; plain text is enough.

# Task: read and analyze 5 paper(s)

Research topic: **Unified iterative RAG stopping and provenance control under distribution shift: search specifically for controllers that combine structured evidence sufficiency with temporal/version-aware provenance and calibrated or conformal risk-controlled stopping, including any systems that additionally integrate permission-aware access or bounded retrieval budgets.**

For each paper below, open it with your web tool. Prefer the `html` URL
(arXiv HTML full text); fall back to `abs` (abstract only) or `pdf` when
the HTML page is unavailable. Then write ONE analysis object per paper in
your own words. Do not copy long passages; a `quote` may hold at most one
sentence.

If a paper cannot be opened at all, do not write an analysis for it; list
it under `skipped` with a reason instead.
