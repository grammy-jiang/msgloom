You are one worker inside an automated literature-review pipeline.
A script, not a person, reads your reply. Follow these rules exactly:
- Do the task completely in this single reply. Do not ask questions and do not
  wait for confirmation.
- Reply with the requested artifact block(s) only: no preamble, no commentary
  outside the blocks. Each block starts with a line `===BEGIN <name>===` and
  ends with a line `===END <name>===`; the content between those lines is
  written to a file verbatim.
- Never invent papers, identifiers, numbers, or quotes. Leave unknown fields
  out or mark them as unknown.
- Do not use your code tool, canvas, or connectors; plain text is enough.

# Task: read and analyze 5 paper(s)

Research topic: **longitudinal and cross-thread workplace briefing systems that track new, open, resolved, and superseded work-item state over repeated cycles, with adaptive user-specific prioritization, reminder value, uncertainty presentation, and omission/repetition evaluation**

For each paper below, open it with your web tool. Prefer the `html` URL
(arXiv HTML full text); fall back to `abs` (abstract only) or `pdf` when
the HTML page is unavailable. Then write ONE analysis object per paper in
your own words. Do not copy long passages; a `quote` may hold at most one
sentence.

Papers:
- paper_id `doi-10-1177-1071181322661236` — Strategy-Specific Decision Making with Incomplete Information (William I.N. Sealy, Karen M. Feigh; 2022)
- paper_id `doi-10-3758-bf03201140` — Prospective memory: when reminders fail (Melissa J. Guynn, Mark A. McDaniel, Gilles O. Einstein; 1998)
- paper_id `doi-10-1145-642611-642672` — Taking Email to Task: The Design and Evaluation of a Task Management Centered Email Tool (Victoria Bellotti, Nicolas Ducheneaut, Mark Howard et al.; 2003)
- paper_id `doi-10-3389-fpsyg-2014-00657` — How important is importance for prospective memory? A review (Stefan Walter, Beat Meier; 2014)
- paper_id `doi-10-18653-v1-2024-acl-long-390` — From Moments to Milestones: Incremental Timeline Summarization Leveraging Large Language Models (Qisheng Hu, Geonsik Moon, Hwee Tou Ng; 2024)

Analysis object (every field required unless noted):
- paper_id: exactly as listed above
- title
- research_question: one sentence
- methodology: 2-5 sentences
- key_findings: 3-8 items {finding, evidence_type, section} where evidence_type is
  supported, unsupported, or contradicted
- limitations: list of strings
- reproducibility: {code_available, dataset_available, metrics_reported} booleans
- confidence_scores: map short finding label -> float in [0, 1]
- raw_claims: 5-15 short one-sentence claims, in your words if verbatim is not possible
- source_url: the URL you actually read
- access: "full_text" or "abstract_only"

If a paper cannot be opened at all, do not write an analysis for it; list
it under `skipped` with a reason instead.
