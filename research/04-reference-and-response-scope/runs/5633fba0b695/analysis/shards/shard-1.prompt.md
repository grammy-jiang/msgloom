You are one worker inside an automated literature-review pipeline.
A script, not a person, reads your reply. Follow these rules exactly:
- Do the task completely in this single reply. Do not ask questions and do not
  wait for confirmation.
- Reply with the requested artifact block(s) only: no preamble, no commentary
  outside the blocks. Each block starts with a line `===BEGIN <name>===` and
  ends with a line `===END <name>===`; the content between those lines is
  written to a file verbatim.
- Never invent papers, identifiers, numbers, or quotes. Leave unknown fields
  out or mark them as unknown.
- Do not use your code tool, canvas, or connectors; plain text is enough.

# Task: read and analyze 5 paper(s)

Research topic: **proposition-level response scope in workplace email and dialogue, with emphasis on partial replies to multi-question or multi-proposition antecedents, unanswered subquestions, approval/rejection scope, and multi-antecedent response links**

For each paper below, open it with your web tool. Prefer the `html` URL
(arXiv HTML full text); fall back to `abs` (abstract only) or `pdf` when
the HTML page is unavailable. Then write ONE analysis object per paper in
your own words. Do not copy long passages; a `quote` may hold at most one
sentence.

Papers:
- paper_id `doi-10-1016-j-pragma-2018-03-015` — ‘But what is the reason why you know such things?’: Question and response patterns in the LADO interview (Alison Channon, Paul Foulkes, Traci Sue Walker; 2018)
- paper_id `doi-10-3115-1708376-1708429` — Contrasting the Interaction Structure of an Email and a Telephone Corpus: A Machine Learning Approach to Annotation of Dialogue Function Units (Jun Hu, Rebecca Passonneau, Owen Rambow; 2009)
- paper_id `doi-10-5210-dad-2022-203` — Characterizing the Response Space of Questions: data and theory (Jonathan Ginzburg, Zulipiye Yusupujiang, Chuyuan Li et al.; 2022)
- paper_id `doi-10-18653-v1-2023-findings-acl-710` — Discourse Analysis via Questions and Answers: Parsing Dependency Structures of Questions Under Discussion (Wei-Jen Ko, Yating Wu, Cutter Dalton et al.; 2023)
- paper_id `doi-10-3115-1220355-1220483` — Detection of Question-Answer Pairs in Email Conversations (Lokesh Shrestha, Kathleen McKeown; 2004)

Analysis object (every field required unless noted):
- paper_id: exactly as listed above
- title
- research_question: one sentence
- methodology: 2-5 sentences
- key_findings: 3-8 items {finding, evidence_type, section} where evidence_type is
  supported, unsupported, or contradicted
- limitations: list of strings
- reproducibility: {code_available, dataset_available, metrics_reported} booleans
- confidence_scores: map short finding label -> float in [0, 1]
- raw_claims: 5-15 short one-sentence claims, in your words if verbatim is not possible
- source_url: the URL you actually read
- access: "full_text" or "abstract_only"

If a paper cannot be opened at all, do not write an analysis for it; list
it under `skipped` with a reason instead.
